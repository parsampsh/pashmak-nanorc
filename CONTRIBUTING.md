# Contribution Guidelines

### Getting started
Before working on an issue, fork the project and create a feature branch. Once you're done working, rebase your changes against the main branch and submit a pull request.

All pull requests must be fully tested before they're submitted for review.

We use the **conventional commit** pattern for our commit messages. Commit messages should include a "type" and a short description (e.g. `fix: add helper methods to show correct trace in sentry (#75)`). For new features, it sometimes makes sense to add a longer description as well. Acceptable commit message types include:

* feat (a new feature)
* fix (a bug fix)
* perf (a performance improvement)
* refactor (a change that improves upon existing code)
* docs (a change to the docs only)
* test (a change that only includes tests)
* chore (a change to CI, etc)

Advance option just for author:

* update (a new update)

Lastly, make sure your commit is signed before submitting the pull request.
